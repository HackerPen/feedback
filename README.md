# HackerPen public feedback

The feedback repository is for communicating HackerPen's roadmap. Weâ€™re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of HackerPen products and features. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through [general feedback in HackerPen public discussions](https://github.com/HackerPen/roadmap/discussions/new?category=general). Please review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.


The feedback repository is for community to submit feedback on how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the HackerPen product team. Check out Submitting feedback to learn how to provide feedback. Please review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before submitting feedback and participating in discussions.

This repository works in conjunction with the [HackerPen public product roadmap](https://github.com/HackerPen/roadmap), which is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Accordingly, the Issues feature of this repository has been disabled. Discussion categories have been established for specific features listed above, as well as a general category for other topics. Additional categories may be added in the future. In the meantime, topics outside of the listed categories above, will be transferred into the general category.

## Roadmap and Feedback

HackerPen has two product intake process, *feedback** and **roadmap**. Each process has its own dedicated purpose and Github repo:

- Roadmap ([Github](https://github.com/HackerPen/roadmap)): driven by HackerPen core team. They tend to be big bets or [big rocks](https://resources.franklincovey.com/the-8th-habit/big-rocks-stephen-r-covey) that the team prioritize. Every roadmap item is an issue.
- Feedback ([Github](https://github.com/HackerPen/feedback)): driven by the HackerPen community. They tend to be bugs or feature requests, every piece of feedback is an issue.
